Lazie
==============

Everytime I have to install many scripts (EditorConfig, JSHint, JSBeautify, etc) in my projects folder, how I'm lazy I created this NodeJS module to install these scripts for me :smile:

To install and use is very simple:

1. Install `nodejs` in your computer
2. After node installed, type in your terminal `npm install -g lazie`
3. How you installed globally this module, it has become available to use like a program from command line. To use it is very easy:

```
Usage: lazie [options]

Options:
   -e, --editorconfig   Install .editorconfig
   -h, --jshint         Install .jshintrc
   -j, --jsbeautify     Install .jsbeautifyrc
   -b, --bowerrc        Install .bowerrc
```
